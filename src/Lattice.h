/**
 The Lattice class stores the decoder search graph (lattice).
 The graph contains a set of vertices and a set of edges, both indexed by integers.
 Due to specifics of Moses search graph, vertices can have arbitrary key, 
 while edges are always enumerated from 0.
 Each edge stores a target language phrase and a vector of transition scores.
 The class is tailored for convex hull search algorithm only.
